------- Changes in new branch -------
Name: changes003
	Version: 0.3
	Add this file as change.log
	Changes:
		* Change the word 'Column' from diff result report to 'byte'.
			In case of ASCII files report as:	First mismatch at: line x, byte y
			In case of binary files report as: 	First mismatch at: byte y
		
		* A DiffFormatter class should be added for proper result formatting in String.
		    toString() from DiffResult should be transferred to this new class.
		* Add a switch for binary & ASCII (default) file comparisions.
			For ASCII files: 	Character based IO streams should be used.
								Another test should be done for difference in line terminators and should be reported separately.
			For binary files: 	Byte based IO streams should be used and line terminators shouldn't be checked for.
		* Update the app version
