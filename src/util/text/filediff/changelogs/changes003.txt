Name: changes003

Version: 0.3

Changes:
	* [DONE] Add this file as a change log

	* [DONE] Change the word 'Column' from diff result report to 'byte'.
        In case of ASCII files report as:	First mismatch at: line x, byte y
        In case of binary files report as: 	First mismatch at: byte y

    * [DISSOLVE] (Deprecated) A DiffFormatter class should be added for proper result formatting in String.
        toString() from DiffResult should be transferred to this new class.

    * [DONE] Changed option -patt to -pattacc and now no need to add -pattign after -patt <pattern-string>.
        Can give directly -pattign|-pattacc <pattern-string>

    * [PARTIAL] Add a switch for binary & ASCII (default) file comparisions.
        For ASCII files: 	[IGNORED] Character based IO streams should be used.
                            [DONE] Another test should be done for differences in line terminators and should be reported separately.
        For binary files: 	[IGNORED] Byte based IO streams should be used.
							[DONE] Line terminators shouldn't be checked for.

    * [DONE] Update the app version
